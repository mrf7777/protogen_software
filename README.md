# Getting started
Go here and read this: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rgb-matrix-bonnet-for-raspberry-pi/driving-matrices

Run step 6 at the home directory of your pi.

Run `sh setup.sh` in this directory. This will build the led matrix library that this repo depends on which allows this project to access the led matrices. It also installs packages which allow for the compilation of utilities in the led matrix library.

Run `sh build.sh` to build this project.
